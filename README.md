# Introduction

This is a set of scripts that setup your workstation for developing applications.
for example, if you are working on an app that has Android, IOS and web clients, Python or dotnet
backends with multiple databases and middleware, you will be dealing with several IDEs and development tools.
Further, if you have colleagues who use a variety of Windows, Ubuntu and Mac workstations, the complexity setting up workstations so you can all work together quickly on the same app will increase.

You can have several apps or projects, and switch between them through one menu.

Workstation1 will help you configure your worksation, and then share that configuration with others.
It contains scripts that install the IDEs and package managers involved in building
applications with frontends, backends, docker images, node modules and dotnet packages.
It works on Windows, WSL, Ubuntu and MacOS.

Your configuration scripts can be written in Powershell, Shell Script (Bash), Python or Pearl.
It shows a menu that lets you choose which development activity you want to startup.

Your workstation configuration scripts can be in an existing repo, or their own repo, or both.

The menus contain activities for each of your major development projects.

The controller that orchestrates the scripts is written in Python.

# Getting started

Clone this repo to wherever you keep your local repos.
Switch to `<repo_dir>/ws1`, then run `./ws1.sh` or, in Windows,`./ws1.ps1`.
This will add the `ws1` command to your path and display the main menu.

# Adding a project to the menu

To add a project to the menu, switch to the root directoy of the project (or any other directory), and then run `ws1 add`.
This will prompt you for the title of your project and then create a `ws1` directory, where you can define your steps.
`ws add` creates a `ws1_project.json` file in the `ws1` directory.
This file defines the project and its attributes.
It also adds the path of the `ws1` directory to ~/.workstation1/project_registry.csv, so that it is included in the main menu.
Create new steps for the project inside a `ws1/steps` directory.
Only create new steps if one does not already exist that does what you want. To get a list of existing steps, run `ws1 list`.

# Projects

A project is an application or system you are working on.
It usually has at least one Git repo.
Each project has a `ws1_project.json` file that defines its attibutes. Here is an example:

```
{
  "id": "webapp",
  "title": "Sample Web App",
  "sourceCodePath": "$REPO_DIR/nhsapp",
  "sortOrder": 10,
  "os": ["macos", "ubuntu"],
  "contact": {
    "email": "nick_etuk@hotmail.com"
  },
  "menu": "main"
}
```

You only need to set the `porjectRoot` if your `ws1` directory, containing your steps and ws1_project.json file, is not in your project's root directory.
You might do this if you do not want your workstation configuration steps to be included in your project's git repo.

The project will be shown in the main menu if the `menu` property is set to `main`.

# Steps

Steps are the Shell script or Powershell code files that actually perform the actions.
Each step has a json configuration file that matches the name of the script file. This specifies the
dependencies and checks that go with the step. It can also contain child steps.
If the step is simple, the code for what it does can be entered as a command directly in the step defintion.

## Showing steps in the main menu

You may want to show some steps in the main menu.
These will be steps that perform major development activities in your project, such as building the backend or deploying to a remote server.
They may contain child steps that do the actual work.
To show a step in the main menu, add a property called `menu` to the step's json configuration file, and set it to `main`.

Here is an example:
`web_development.json`

```
{
  "id": "web",
  "menu": "main",
  "sortOrder": 10,
  "title": "Web development",
  "steps": [
    "install_node",
    "activate_node",
    "install_backend",
    "install_vscode",
    "install_text_editor",
    "configure_backend",
    "build_backendworker",
    "build_web",
    "start_docker",
    "docker_login",
    "start_backendworker",
    "start_http_server",
    "open_vscode"
  ]
}
```

Step Ids must be unique across all projects.

If the step has an `exitTo` property, when the step is completed, the OS shell will switch to the specified path.
By default, the path is relative to the project root directory.
If the path begins with a `/` or a `<drive letter>:\`, it is treated as an absolute path.
You can include `..`, `..\\..` and so on in the path to refer to a directory above the project directory.
You can also include environment variable in the path.

## Checks

Each step has an expression called a "check". This is used to work out if the step has been done or not.
The checks look like this:

{
"dependencies": [],
"checks": {
"macos": ["command -v keybase | grep -q keybase"],
"ubuntu": ["true"]
}
}

The checks can be OS specific - macos, ubuntu, win. Unix means macos or ubuntu.
The file name of the step, without the exension, must be unique across all projects.
It must match the file name of it's json configuration file.
For example, if the step file is named install_docker.sh, its configuration file should be install_docker.json.
Step files can be writen in bash shell script (.sh) or in Windows, in Powershell (.ps1). Support will soon be added for other scripting languages.

## Other step properties

**runOnce:** If true, the step will only be run if it has not been run before. This is usefull for installation or build process that take a long time and you don't want to run again unless necessary. Controlled through a file in the .workstation1 directory in the user's home directory.
**runAlways:** Aways run the step without checking entry and exit checks. Dependencies and child steps are still executed.
**exitTo:** The path to switch to when the step is completed. By default, this is relative to the project root directory.
**newTab:** If true, the step will be run in a new terminal tab.
**steps:** A list of child step Ids to run as part of this step.
**isActive:** If false, the step will be ignored.

## Scope

The scope of a step can be public or private. By default, steps are public. Private steps are steps that do nothing useful by themseleves,
but a libraries or sub-modules for other steps. Private steps are not shown when you run `ws list`.

## Step names

The name of the step config file must match the name of the script file.
For example, if the step script is `install_node.sh`, the step config file must be `install_node.json`.
Step names must be unique across all projects.

# Uniquenes of Ids

Step Ids must be unique across all projects, since a step defined in one project can be used in all projects.
Project Ids must be unique.

# CLI commands

- `ws1`: Shows the main menu. This contains a list of all projects and menu steps.
- `ws <step Id>`: Runs the specified step.
- `ws1 list`: Lists all steps in all projects.
- `ws1 add`: Adds a new project to the menu.
- `ws1 scan`: Updates the step registry with the latest steps from all projects.
  Run this command after adding new steps.
- `ws1 help`: Shows the help menu.
